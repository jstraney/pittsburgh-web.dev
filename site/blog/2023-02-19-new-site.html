          <h3>The First Step is Always the Hardest</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, it's Jeff! I've been working as a web developer or software engineer
            since 2013 and have wanted to really start a blog/website. I had one before
            at orlandoweb.dev (domain available?), but have since moved from Orlando, Florida to Pittsburgh
            Pennsylvania and have had many developments personally and professionally.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may have found your way here from a blog post, or a tutorial on the site. All projects deserve
            an introduction or a prologue, and that's the purpose of this post.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Start a Blog?</h3>
          <p>
            Software, and web development by association, is hard work and one of the things that makes
            it hard is the abundant specifications and technologies. I'm starting this website/blog for
            two main reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To help other developers understand technology using:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear, working examples.</li>
              <li>Direct and opinionated answers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>To raise some questions of my own.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How Did I Pick this Line of Work?</h3>
          <p>
            My story does not begin with assembling my first computer or inventing a programming language.
            I was not any more saavy than kids my age. I consumed console games instead of installing them on a PC, and didn't
            dabble with linux, programming, or math until much later. Instead, I liked drawing and
            enjoying being a kid. I still think American public schools are
            in dire need of reform and I regret nothing about my early life. (:
          </p>
          <p>
            Though, by an older sister's recommendation, I tried a college intro to C class where they (thankfully)
            gave us a few weeks to try python first. The teacher was tough but fair, and I managed to really enjoy
            the class and haven't been the same since. When I saw the creativity that went into problem solving
            I decided that this was going to be my vocation.
          </p>

          <h3>What Advice Do You Have for Beginners?</h3>
          <p>
            Taking a class was great way to commit to learning the basics. These are some common questions
            beginners ask (and I may have asked a few times starting out):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>So do you just memorize all these commands?</li>
            <li>What is the point to the commands I learned?</li>
            <li>I'm lost (more of a statement, but okay)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To these points, I say:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You will have to memorize some things in order to succeed, but learning how to look it up is more important.</li>
            <li>The point is to prepare you for more commands (at least for a while).</li>
            <li>Feeling confused just means you recognize you don't know something. It's the important first step to learning something.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Outro</h3>
          <p>
            Thanks for reading the prelude to what will be a very fun project to continue. I hope you enjoy it!
