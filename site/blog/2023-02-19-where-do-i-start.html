          <h2>Where Do I Start as a Developer?</h2>
          <p>
            You're deciding that you'd like to learn programming, eh? Maybe you decided you need a change of
            careers and heard this one has decent pay and security. You may know a someon who is currently thriving
            at it and has suggested it. It's a good decision: if you can commit to learning, that is.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is it, though? What do programmers do? A "programmer", is a generic term
            for someone who solves problems using a programming language.
            The good news is, no one is hiring for a job
            title of "programmer". If I saw a job with this title, I would click out of morbid
            curiousity. It would be like seeing a job post for "boss person".
          </p>
          <p>
            So if a programmer is a person who solves problems with programming languages, what are
            the problems that need solving? What are programming languages? This is where you start.
            Because it's these gists that direct us to the following destination.
          </p>
          <h2>What Is a Programming Language?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm going to give you the dumbest but most useful definition. <em>A programming language is a language
            that goes into a computer to tell it to transform data and put it somewhere else.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is far from what most text books will tell you, but this is the truth. This is the barebones fact of
            what a programming language <em>does</em>. As far as what data is, you may have heard that data is
            1's and 0's or bits. The truth is, most data is moved around as <em>bytes</em> which is typically
            eight bits. Sequence of bytes are used in the computers processor to add, multiply,
            and do other maths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most languages are built on other languages and don't directly touch these bytes.
          </p>
          <h2>What Problems do Programmers Solve?</h2>
          <p>
            We are at a point in time where we want to solve <em>everything</em> with code. This is not possible, so
            the quick and general answer is this: <em>programming languages solve problems revolving around data,
            which is what they do work upon.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because data lives in files, streams from network sockets, or just floats around in RAM, and there
            are there different business domains with specific problems pertaining to data, many different languages
            have been invented. Some examples of languages and what they're good for (I put a star next to some that
            are good to start with):

          <p>
            I put two &#11088;'s next to python because it is by far one of the most <em>plain english</em> like programming
            language with least syntax to learn, plus strong-typing (so you learn a bit about types). From there, you could
            pick up PHP JavaScript, HTML and CSS if you want to learn more web development. Or something like Java or Go
            if you want to learn how to build desktop applications.
          </p>

          <h2>Keep At It</h2>
          <p>
            No one learns, or even masters their first language over night. I would say expect at least a few years
            to get half-way decent with one. Although, most developers who pick up one language learn many. Each
            language has a unique approach to solving problems, but they each borrow ideas from each other.
